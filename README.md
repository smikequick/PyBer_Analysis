## **Overview of Analysis**

### ***Purpose***
The company PyBer has been attempting to better understand how city type impacts a variety of factors such as fare, drivers, average rates by both, and more! The CEO of PyBer wants to further this analysis with digging deeper into how city type and weekly rate interact.


## **Results**

The first analysis that was conducted was manipulating the data to create a table that illustrates the different types of cities (e.g. rural, suburban, and urban). Within this table, there are different metrics that can be assessed for each city including: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. See the table below.

### ***Summary Table by City Type***

In reviewing this data, there are a few key takeaways that can be extracted from the table. Specifically, overall ride totals are higher in more densely populated areas (i.e. urban total rides are greater than suburban, suburban total rides are greater than rural, etc). Similarly, this trend follows with total drivers as well, presumably because there are more rides to give in more densely populated areas. Total fares follows a similar pattern, with more money being made in areas that have more rides and driver. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are interesting data points since they do not follow the pattern illustrated above. The average fare per ride is higher in less densely populated areas which means the average fare per driver is high in those specific regions. This could be due in part to longer rides in rural areas and a higher demand for a low number of drivers.

### ***PyBer Fare Summary by Week (Jan - Apr 2019)***

Further analysis was conducted to better understand the total fare by city type. See the chart below.

In reviewing, this chart, it comes as no surprise that the conclusions indicated in the table above holds true with the chart when look at weekly fare amounts. More densely populated regions continue to make overall higher earnings. There are some interesting findings in regards to when certain city types tend to result in higher earnings, as it doesn't appear that each city type experiences the same surge or drop in earnings. For example, all city types seem to experience a peak around the third week of February when it comes to earnings. However, some weeks see mixed results in terms of earnings (e.g. see the last week of January/first week of February; see the last week of March, first week of April). This illustrates that there are certain peak times where there is a dip in earnings for one city type and a surge for another.


## **Summary**

Based on the data presented above, there are three recommendations for PyBer to continue seeing increased earnings and a growing user base. 

### ***Snapshot of Recommendations***

1) Offer incentives to increase the total number of drivers in rural and suburban areas. 
2) Create ways to decrease the overall fare per ride in less densely populated areas.
3) Strategically leverage "surge" time periods to increase the number of drivers available based on city type.

### ***Explanation of Recommendations***

First, by offering incentives to increase the total number of drivers in rural and suburban areas, there is an opportunity to see the total fares increase. In urban settings there are more drivers than total rides. This is the opposite circumstances in suburban and rural areas. Second, in conjunction with the first recommendation, there are alternative ways to decrease the overall fare per ride, which could be a price tag that deters riders from using PyBer and potentially using Pyft. This could come through increased drivers, but it also could be through intentional incentives during peak windows (e.g. $5 off your next ride, or $10 off your ride in X month where X is a month with a lower number of riders on average). Finally, in addition to the recommendations above, it could be beneficial to increase drivers during peak windows by city type. These vary by city type, but could be a way to adapt to demand for drivers based on city type need (e.g. more drivers in rural areas at the start of April and perhaps less in suburban areas).
